Test #1: Comparison to Davis, et al 2012 figure 4. 
Exponential thickening atmosphere with high non-LTE scattering
-----------------------

Code used: short1DnLTE.m, revision Fri Jul 25 20:45:00
Manually hard-coded the two-stream approximation to get mu = [1, -1]

Observations:
Stability changes when increasing the range of X_tot-- the ALI iterations will level off in change and throw NaNs in intensity

I think this only happens when the gradient X_tot becomes too large

nz= 10,000 appears to be the limit for computaitonal feasibility in current serial MATLAB implementation

Using the following parameters: 
nz = 50000;
ntheta = 2; 
nf = 1; 
MAX_ITER = 10000; 
delta_c = 1e-4; 
lz = 50.0;
thermal_source = ones
X_tot(:,1) = 5*exp(zz./lz); %exponentially thickening atmosphere
destruction_prob = 1e-2*ones(nz,1);  

I get a plot that more or less matches the shape of the analytic result.
However, the entire functional shape is shifted to the left and there are definitive boundary issues as the mean_intensity drops to zero on the RHS

Investigation reveals that the approximate ALI operator, lambda_star, suffers from a sharp discontinuity at the beginning of the domain

Attempts at fixing:
---------------------
halved the normalized_intensity at the beginning and end of the array. No effect

The obvious candidate is the inclusion of the boundary conditions, I^- and I^+ in the ALI
However, restricting the updates of delta_source to 
nonbndry points doesnt have an effect

closer investigation reveals that the mean_intensity crashes near the RHS bndry (only to come back up to 1 for the last pt?-- this was due to me cutting the bndry points off) 

Looking at the two-stream intensities shows that ther is a correct diminution of the intensity near the more opaque side, but it doesnt level off as in Davis12

Take a step back to the LTE case--
with destruction probability=1, we get correct convergence of each stream to the thermal source function, with the boundaries exponentially rising

Does this just mean we need to go optically deeper to ignore scattering effects at the bndry?
Currently, we are going 5e3 deep
--Ans: nope, going deeper still preserves about 3 cells that drop near the boundary

Going deeper reduces the drop in the source function somewhat. I need a logarithmic/nonuniform spatial discretization in order to capture the entire range effectively, as in Davisi12

Update, 8/7
------------
After meeting with Prof. Stone, I realized that im handling the boundary conditions incorrectly. Specifically, it should be a semi-infintie atmosphere.
Does that mean that the RHS source_function bndry should be equal to thermal source?


Investigation of the solution after one iteration shows that the lambda_star operator is mixing in the fixed boundary conditions to pollute the solution at the RHS boundary. 

normalized_intensity(1,...), normalized_intensity(nz,...) are anomolous, as to be expected

Even with the restriction of the lambda_star updates to exclude the boundary, we still get the delta_source largest near the RHS boundary. 

WHAT ARE THE OPTICAL DEPTHS AT THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS??

The RHS is fixed when you use the BC from infinity, that is, intensity ---> thermal source

For now, the mismatach from the LHS will be allowed and written off as a product of the insufficient spatial resolution to optical depth 10-4
