Test #1: Comparison to Davis, et al 2012 figure 4. 
Exponential thickening atmosphere with high non-LTE scattering
-----------------------

Code used: short1DnLTE.m, revision Fri Jul 25 20:45:00
Manually hard-coded the two-stream approximation to get mu = [1, -1]

Observations:
Stability changes when increasing the range of X_tot-- the ALI iterations will level off in change and throw NaNs in intensity

nz= 10,000 appears to be the limit for computaitonal feasibility in current serial MATLAB implementation

Using the following parameters: 
nz = 50000;
ntheta = 2; 
nf = 1; 
MAX_ITER = 10000; 
delta_c = 1e-4; 
lz = 50.0;
thermal_source = ones
X_tot(:,1) = 5*exp(zz./lz); %exponentially thickening atmosphere
destruction_prob = 1e-2*ones(nz,1);  

I get a plot that more or less matches the shape of the analytic result.
However, the entire functional shape is shifted to the left and there are definitive boundary issues as the mean_intensity drops to zero on the RHS

Investigation reveals that the approximate ALI operator, lambda_star, suffers from a sharp discontinuity at the beginning of the domain

Attempts at fixing:
---------------------
halved the normalized_intensity at the beginning and end of the array. No effect

The obvious candidate is the inclusion of the boundary conditions, I^- and I^+ in the ALI
However, restricting the updates of delta_source to 
nonbndry points doesnt have an effect

closer investigation reveals that the mean_intensity crashes near the RHS bndry (only to come back up to 1 for the last pt?) 

Looking at the two-stream intensities shows that ther is a correct diminution of the intensity near the more opaque side, but it doesnt level off as in Davis12

Take a step back to the LTE case--
with destruction probability=1, we get correct convergence of each stream to the thermal source function, with the boundaries exponentially rising

Does this just mean we need to go optically deeper?
